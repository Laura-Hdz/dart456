           <h1>Biographical Statement / <a href="../images/LauraHernandez-CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a></h1>
           <p>Hi! I’m Laura. I’m a graphic designer and esports fan from Montreal who enjoys working on publication, promotional and web design projects. You’ll often find me implementing bright colours into my designs while focusing on simplicity and intuitiveness. I have developed a strong sense of punctuality, teamwork and problem-solving skills that stem from successfully working under tight deadlines and collaborative projects. As an avid gamer, I’ve become highly involved in the world of esports, both as a viewer and a participant—I’m now looking to use my design skills to help this industry grow and to spread its enjoyment. If you would like to work together or simply join me in a game of League of Legends (or even introduce me to a new game!), please don’t hesitate to contact me at hdzc.laura@gmail.com.</p>

           </p>
           <p>My love for esports has lead me to look for opportunities to grow as a designer within this industry, yet I’ve seen a lot of instances of “can you do this for free” and “I taught myself Photoshop so I’m a graphic designer”. For this reason, Team Liquid, one of the leading and largest esports organizations in the west, has been a constant source of inspiration in regards to visual identity and brand growth through their focus on professional graphic design work. They’re constantly creating new visuals while remaining loyal to their branding guidelines to integrate any new games they become involved with. They also work to help their contracted players grow their own personal brand by creating logos and a unique visual identity to represent them, rather than forcing them to showcase the Team Liquid one. Their designers are in constant contact with the community and share their thoughts and opinions on their design choices. This is particularly helpful for someone looking to get into the esports field, since it provides insight on the process an esports-focused designer goes through when working with an organization. In addition to all of this, they’re also one of the few orgs (or perhaps the only one, since I haven’t been able to find others) that officially publishes their branding guidelines and explain the ideas behind their designs. Everything from their streaming assets to their apparel is thoughtfully designed and portrays the work and experience of their graphic designers.
